# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Web Application
The Sentiment Analysis Web Application is a Flask-based web application designed to analyze the sentiment of text reviews. The application utilizes machine learning models to classify text as positive, neutral, or negative. The core features of the application include loading machine learning models, defining API endpoints for handling requests and responses, and integrating with a frontend interface for user interaction.

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning Model Integration**: The application loads pre-trained machine learning models for sentiment analysis.
- **API Endpoints**: The application defines API endpoints for handling HTTP requests and responding with sentiment analysis results.
- **Frontend Interface**: The application integrates with a frontend interface for users to input text reviews and view sentiment analysis results.
- **Data Storage**: The application stores cleaned and formatted review data in a CSV file.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, joblib
- **Data Manipulation**: pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: CSV files for data storage
